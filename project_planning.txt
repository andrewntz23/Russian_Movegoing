we have 8 that are structurally marked up, finish the last one. 


4 are currently good to go: letâ€™s do reference tags. 


Reference and index:

persons, titles, place, genre, national cinema. 

index:




Lena: edit the index schema. finish proofreading along with Sasha and finish non-lexical hesitation markup 

Tom: reference markup for 4 documents, updated index as you go. 

Sasha: Finish structural markup. Linguistic markup for at least one full document (Alyrzaeva). finish proofreading along with Lena and finish non-lexical hesitation markup. 

non-pronoun personal national 



possessive vs personal 

singular vs plural 

private vs national 


We're going to add in a <collective> tag that will go around moments like narod, lyudi, etc. 

Remove quotation marks around any title things; they are pseudo-markup.
