        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>In the investigation of the St. Petersburg moviegoing population's construction of
            memory, the authors chose to analyze and mark up four types of features in the interview
            transcripts, all of which are accessible to the user in xslt format. The authors were
            primarily interested in investigating: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>References made by the interviewees in their responses: <ul>
                    <li>Persons</li>
                    <li>Places</li>
                    <li>Film Titles</li>
                    <li>Genres</li>
                    <li>National Cinemas</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Markers of hesitation in the interviewees' speech</li>
            <li>Interviewees' usage of pronouns in their speech</li>
            <li>The epithetes interviewees associated with their experiences</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In order to investigate these questions, the authors chose to tag transcripts of the
            interviews in XML format using the text editor, Oxygen, and then to output their data in
            the form of XSLT documents.</p>
