        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The Russian Movie Theater Project is an ongoing investigation into the St. Petersburg
            moviegoing population's construction of memory concerning their experiences at the
            movies. Developed by Elena Prokhorova and Sasha Prokhorov of the College of William and
            Mary, this project aims to collect primary source information by interviewing
            individuals and asking them to describe their experiences as moviegoers. The site
            currently contains the full interactive text of nine interviews conducted over a six
            year timespan from 2008 to 2014. All interviews were conducted in person by William and
            Mary Russian students studying abroad in St. Petersburg.</p>
