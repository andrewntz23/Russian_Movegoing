        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was born
            in Volgograd province. And in 1982 … and from 1982 on I’ve been living in St.
            Petersburg. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember the first time you went to the
            movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was a long time ago. Maybe when <pron
                type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was five. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember the movie you went to see? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was a <genre ref="skazka">fairy tale</genre>. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Could you please explain the movie? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">The impression from watching the movie or its
            plot? </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">About the experiences. </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">About the experiences. The sensation…it was a
            long time ago, it really was. The first big screen at the movies for me was something
            unusual. Some sort of <genre ref="skazka">fairy tale film</genre>. It was a version for kids, that all of life is a
            fairy tale, oh so beautiful. Those were the first impressions. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Who did you go with? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">With <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron>
            mom. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How did you like the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            haven’t been in a modern movie theater, because in connection with work, with <pron
                type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> profession, there just isn’t time to go. But
                <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> first impression…what a huge building with
            big seats, something very enjoyable, something new, it wasn’t quite a house. <pron
                type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> didn’t have a TV set then, <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> didn’t know what that was. But of course it was very, very
            enjoyable. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When did you start going to the movies by yourself? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was…well, <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> didn’t go alone, only sometime around sixteen, when <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> was sixteen years old. Surely only then. And even so <pron
                type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> went together to the movie theater. With school.
            Or there was a showing for us at school, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had a
            not too big movie room. They showed them to us there or <pron type="pers" number="plur"
                >we</pron> went in a group to the movie theater. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you like going to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> liked
            it, of course <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> liked it. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How often did you go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Not very often. Maybe once a month or once every
            two months. Because it was such an expensive treat… </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How did your habit of going to the movies change
            when you grew up? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It changed profoundly. When <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> was a kid, and when I, well, became a teenager and then
            already a full-grown adult…Earlier cinema was more accessible to the people, it was
            accessible for the people. It was just more full of life, not like today. Now these
            films like <genre ref="blockbuster">blockbusters</genre>, everything is very strange and a bit incomprehensible. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">What were your favorite genres in childhood? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">As a child, <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> think it was <genre ref="skazka">fairy tales</genre> and those educational programs. <title ref="inTheAnimalWorld">In the World of Animals</title>, <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> had a show like that, and many, many people watched it.
            <genre ref="documentary">Documentaries</genre>. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you have a favorite movie? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="poss" number="plur">Our</pron>
            classics. But not just one, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> think there are
            very many, the films of <person ref="gaidai">Gaidai</person>, <title ref="diamondArm">The Diamond Arm</title>…and
            others. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Explain the movies, please. </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">They’re <genre ref="comedy">comedies</genre>. They became classics. Or <title ref="ivanVasilevichChangesJobs">Ivan Vasilievich Changes his Profession</title>. You
            too surely know it. They’re really interesting and really lively. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you have favorite actors and actresses? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes, of course. They were and still remain,
            although they’re not still alive. Well…<person ref="leonov">Eugene Leonov</person>. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why were they your favorite actors? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know why…watching them at the movies, you, maybe how you experienced the role that they
            were playing together with them. And it was very interesting, how they acted. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Could you repeat the question? </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Outing to the movie theater? That was a long time
            ago. Well, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know. Many different films,
            and the <genre ref="classics">classics</genre>, and <genre ref="warFilms">war movies</genre>. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really liked
            them as a kid. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> also had <title ref="elusiveAvengers">The Elusive Avengers</title>, it was a revolutionary film.
            There young boys played the roles. A young girl and young boys. <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> really liked that. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know. Maybe they had such adventurous topics, perhaps because <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> were about the same age. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember a screening on television, a movie
            on television? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well…the first movie, no…Yes. The first movie,
            probably, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know, but <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> remember <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> saw the
            ballet <title ref="swanLake">Swan Lake</title> on TV. But that was uncommon. It was
            really, really beautiful. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> liked the music in
            the show. And <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really liked the girls, who were
            acting. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was really little then. The first time
                <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> saw it. There were in really pretty
            dresses, in tutus…they were all white, so unusual. It was that, probably, that left such
            a strong impression on me. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really, really liked
            ballet. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember when you saw it? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was probably 1959. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How did you spend your free time, apart from going
            to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            had a lot. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> lived in, how can one say this…such
            a little village, like in the countryside. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had
            so many chores around the house, so much work. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            helped <pron type="poss" number="plur">our</pron> parents. <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> had a lot of animals. <pron type="pers" number="plur"
                >we</pron> took care of them, fed them. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            read books. There, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had vacation in the
            summertime. After school <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> were off for three
            months. Well and they absolutely gave us a big assignment in school, in order for us to
            ready many books over the summer. Well whatever, <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> really like to read. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Who did you usually go to the movies with? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, when <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> was little, with <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> mom or with
                <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> older sister or <pron type="poss"
                number="sing">my</pron> brother. And then <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            would go with <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> friends. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there more men or women at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">No, it was really equal. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did people often go to the movies with their
            families or with their friends/girlfriends? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know. How to say…it was generally different, maybe you went one tie with your friends,
            then another time with family. Parents with their kids. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there lines at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes, there were lines. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember waiting in line? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">What kind of movie? <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> remember <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was
            studying in Volgograd, and <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> went with <pron
                type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> friend. The film was called <title ref="womanWhoSings">The Woman Who Sings</title>. <pron type="poss" number="plur"
                >our</pron> famous singer <person ref="pugacheva">Alla Borisovna Pugacheva</person> starred in that movie. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why did you like it? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, how. She became a famous singer and a new
            movie came out. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> really like seeing and
            listening to her new songs and seeing her not like a singer, but like an actress. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you know people who worked at the movie
            theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">At the movie theater…probably not. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How was the atmosphere in the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">What was it like in the movie hall? With how the
            kids behaved, who came to the movies? It depended on the film they were showing, they
            shouted, clapped. But when it was quiet, someone cried. What a topic there was in the
            movie, if it was sad. When it was funny, everyone laughed. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you eat anything at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">No. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            think that wasn’t permitted. If a person came to watch a film, that meant that all his
            attention had to be turned to the screen, and he had to watch, and not snack. There was
            another place for that. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">But there was food service in the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Other people ate? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, sometimes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">What did they eat? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, something there. Pies, sandwiches. What
            they sold. Lemonade – like you have Coca Cola, Peps<pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> Cola, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> have lemonade. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">And ice cream? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            didn’t have ice cream. It was like that only in the city, they only seldom brought us
            ice cream in the store. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you watch foreign movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Foreign ones? Yes <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> watched foreign movies. Well, and like today with <pron type="poss"
                number="plur">our</pron> new movies, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            really like <nationalCinema ref="foreignCinema">foreign movies</nationalCinema>. There’s a lot of…some sort of violence and murder there.
            Well, maybe it’s like that, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know. I’m
            somehow closer to <pron type="poss" number="plur">our</pron> movies. We’re brought up on
            <genre ref="patrioticFilms">patriotic movies</genre>, on <genre ref="skazka">fairy tales</genre>, something like that. Well, there are really good
            <nationalCinema ref="foreignCinema">foreign movies</nationalCinema>, I’m not saying that it’s all just <nationalCinema ref="americanCinema">American</nationalCinema>, <nationalCinema ref="frenchCinema">French cinema</nationalCinema> there, no.
            There are really good movies. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> watch them with
            enjoyment. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any films you’ve seen? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Foreign ones? <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> can say <title ref="spartacus">Spartacus</title>, yours, but <pron
                type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t remember the director or the actors.
            There’s <title ref="alexander">Alexander</title>, yours, <title ref="troy">Troy</title>
            and maybe there’s others, historical ones like this, of course, these very
            effects-driven movies. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you like historical films? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. They’re really good. <title ref="gladiator"
                >Gladiator</title>, although in these movies, of course, very many of their plots
            are also tragic. But the movies are very interesting. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When did you see this movie? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well…it was last year <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> saw it. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">And <title ref="spartacus">Spartacus</title> also? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">And what movies do you like most of all? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">There’s also foreign comedies. <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> really like ones with <person ref="deFunes">Louis de Funes</person>. French movies. Where
            <person ref="marais">Jean Marais</person> plays. He’s already gone. One and the other, they died. Well Timothy Dalton
            is still making movies. Now I’ll say, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> saw
                <title ref="janeEyre">Jane Eyre</title>. The film’s called <title ref="janeEyre"
                >Jane Eyre</title>. <person ref="dalton">Timothy Dalton</person> plays in the movie. <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> really like it. Him too…like there’s a not too big story
            there. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">And do you like Timothy Dalton? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you have a favorite foreign actor? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well…<pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            don’t know. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> like ones with <person ref="rourke">Mickey Rourke</person>.
            Rukenhauer? Did <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> get his name right? Also, well,
                <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> could name many, there are many good
            actors. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there movies you weren’t allowed to go to? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, yes. With us it was forbidden, they
            wouldn’t let you go up until sixteen. The movie theater only until four o’clock. And
            there they showed only <genre ref="childrens">children’s films</genre>. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Your parents didn’t let you go or the movie
            theater’s administration? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, the administration, and the school, but
                <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> parents too, how to say…they didn’t forbid
            it. At nine o’clock <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had to come home if <pron
                type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> were out. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Yes. Did you try to go out, to a film you weren’t
            allowed to go to? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="plur">We</pron> tried,
            but they didn’t let us in. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any film that had problems coming
            to the screen? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            don’t know, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> can’t say that…Well, maybe the
            censor forbade some films. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Excuse me? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was like that before, there was a commission.
            They, when a film was ready, it was supposed to come to the big screen at the movie
            theater, they watched it and gave their decision, whether it was okay or not. Well <pron
                type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did your parents go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">They went, but very rarely, when there was time. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">What did they watch when they went? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, different kinds of movies that were <pron
                type="poss" number="plur">our</pron> <genre ref="classics">classics</genre>, and <genre ref="comedy">comedies</genre>, well foreign films,
                <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> can’t say their names now, because <pron
                type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was very little. Well, whatever was at the movie
            theater, they tried when they were able to go to the movie theater to see, and they were
            interested in finding out how another country lived. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you still go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> would
            like to, but only if there were time and the opportunity, of course. But now, when there
            is time, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> watch movies on television. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How and why did your experiences of movie theaters
            change? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Well, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            haven’t been in a contemporary movie theater. Like <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> don’t know now…what there is and stereo movies, different screening halls.
            Before there was just a typical screening hall with chairs and a big screen. Of course,
            the first impression was atypical for us when <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            went to the movies, but it was very enjoyable. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            can’t compare today, because <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> haven’t been in a
            new theater. You could ask the younger generation though. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When was the last time when you went to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Oy, the last time, huh? Well, ten years ago.
